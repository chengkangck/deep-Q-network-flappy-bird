# deep-Q-network-flappy-bird

# Overview

This project follows the description of the Deep Q Learning algorithm described in Playing Atari with Deep Reinforcement Learning [1]
and shows that this learning algorithm can be further generalized to the notorious Flappy Bird.
Deep Reinforcement learning is first proposed in this paper.Deep-Q network is proposed and achieved in this paper, which achieved in learning
Atrari game by image input.

# Installation Dependencies:
Python 2.7 or 3
TensorFlow 1.7
pygame

# What is Deep Q-Network?
It is a convolutional neural network, trained with a variant of Q-learning, whose input is raw pixels and whose output is a value function estimating future rewards.

For those who are interested in deep reinforcement learning, I highly recommend to read the following post:
